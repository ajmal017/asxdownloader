# asxdownloader

Since the recent addition of the yfinance module developed by the absolute gun Ran Aroussi (https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance), I thought it made sense to have a marketwide downloading mechanism for a variety of markets. At the moment that is just going to be limited to the ASX as its open when I'm awake. 

The basic premise is fairly simple - download all the ASX stocks and do a filter for nice chart characteristics. In practice it can be made vastly more advanced with the help of an SQL database with a series of abstractions generated by market filters (which I have implemented myself but haven't written as yet for this particular git repo as it is intended to help my friends learn python, higher level math and financial markets simultaneously).

Usage: 

  from ASXTesting import asxDownloader
